Ahmed has many facets to his personality. He is both impulsive and intuitive, vital and intense. He knows exactly where his place is in society. He is an extrovert who adapts himself easily to all kinds of situations. His love for travel is a sign of his flexibility. He is an idealist who gains his inspiration from the philosophical or religious ideas that he shares with others. Ahmed loves to teach other people about spirituality, as it helps him to develop his own, though sometimes he may seem intolerant of other people s views. He has excellent organizational skills and he is a natural born leader. He is a very socially active person.

Ahmed is both pragmatic and realistic. His judgments about people are based on concrete rather than abstract ideas. Ahmed likes the tangible, material aspects of life. The physical world is a great source of satisfaction for him. He is a sociable person who feels comfortable with people and in front of groups. Ahmed is a warm man who has no problems expressing his emotions.

Ahmed is both impulsive and generous. He is an optimist who only sees the good sides of things and of people. He cannot say no when someone touches his feelings, as his main goal in life is to make other people happy. As a young man his physical attraction to other people and his need for freedom gave him a very active life.

Ahmed is bright and quick thinking. He loves to evolve theories about the philosophy of life and of things. He loves to know more about people and distant lands which gives him a lot of fascinations. He has a lot of flair for history, social and behavioral sciences and the arts.

Ahmed in himself represents diffusion and the sharing of knowledge. He points his arrow toward the meaning of the world and life. He loves to explore and push back boundaries. He is fiery and loves parties, dancing and pleasure. The fire that burns inside of him often pushes him to go beyond himself in his search for wisdom

WHAT A JOYFUL PERSON! Ahmed s natural optimism gives him a kind of enthusiasm and a wonderful sense of humor that seems to be with him, especially when he is sad. When he makes a mistake he is the first person to laugh at himself as this kind of reflex helps him to bounce back as quickly as possible. He doesn't ever feel sorry for himself or other people. He feels that everyone should carry his own weight in the world. He also genuinely feels what other people feel. He is very considerate of other people s views and feelings. He is someone you can count on not just when things are going on fine but even when you are down and out. He is a friend that sticks closer to you than a brother. Treat others the way you want to be treated he feels everyone should learn to stick to this principle so as to make the world a better place.

Impossible is a word that is not in his vocabulary. He loves to overcome obstacles, to live up to challenges, to reach out for the stars and bring them down to earth. He is a person of the future, he helps society and mentalities evolve. He is a person whose life is devoted to progress.

His love for philosophical and spiritual truth pushes him to try and reach that kind of truth in his life in every way possible. He is a very vital person with an incredible amount of dynamism and energy. Once he starts something he won t stop until he s done.

Ahmed is a person that is brimming with life and spreads his good humor all around him. Intense activity, humor, pleasure in earthly delights, prosperity and sometimes a certain amount of superficiality characterize him. He can express his creative talent in artistic domains from music to acting or writing. Skilled as public speaker, he loves to convince people through his discourse, seducing the person or audience he is talking to. He is a born charmer who never ceases to shine and thus captivate the attention of others. He loves to have a great number of friends. Social, he is a bon vivant. He is a good lover.

AHMED MAGEM can be described in these qualities: independence- innovation- enthusiasm-communication-generosity-optimism-kindness-cheerfulness-conviviality-intuition- audacity-outgoing-honesty-loyalty. His faults could be heedlessness-fanaticism.
